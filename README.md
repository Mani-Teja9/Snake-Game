ðŸŽ® **Project Showcase: Snake Game** ðŸŽ®

I'm thrilled to present my latest project: **Snake Game**! This classic and addictive game is built using JavaScript (89.6%), CSS (8.9%), and HTML (1.5%).

**Project Highlights:**
- **JavaScript-Powered Gameplay:** The core mechanics and interactive features are driven by JavaScript, ensuring a smooth and responsive gaming experience.
- **Clean and Simple Design:** Utilizes CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **Efficient HTML Structure:** Employs HTML for a solid foundation, ensuring semantic structure and easy maintenance.

The Snake Game highlights my ability to develop engaging and interactive web applications with a primary focus on JavaScript.
